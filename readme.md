# Microsoft Movie Studio Analysis (Data Science) By Pete Njagi
Introduction
• This movie studio pitch is a presentation where I use data on previous films to pitch ideas to a movie studio division  to Microsoft for funding and production support.
• This pitch is will also be delivered in the form of a slide presentation, highlighting the key elements of the market analysis, and potential audience appeal.

## Business Understanding

In response to the growing trend of original video content production by major companies, Microsoft has decided to venture into the film industry by establishing its own movie studio. This project aims to explore current trends in the movie industry to provide actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Data Preparation

The project involves the collection and preparation of relevant movie data. The dataset includes information on movie budgets, gross revenues, release dates, and other pertinent details. The data will be cleaned, organized, and prepared for further exploration.

## Data Understanding

A comprehensive understanding of the dataset is crucial for effective analysis. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and visualizations will be employed to gain insights into the dataset's structure, variables, and relationships.

## Data Analysis

The analysis phase will identify factors significantly impacting a movie's success. Correlation analyses, statistical tests, and machine learning models may be employed to uncover patterns, preferences, and trends that can guide decision-making for Microsoft's movie studio.

## Visualization

Visualizations will be created to present key findings in a clear and compelling manner. Bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps will be used to highlight trends, distributions, and correlations within the data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine.
